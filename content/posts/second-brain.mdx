### What is a second brain?

An external centralized digital repository for everything that you learned or want to remember for a later date and where it's from. In short a methodology of capturing everything that sparks your interest somewhere that is not inside your head. A way of life of getting all your thoughts documented for later review.

This has been very useful for me in building a personal library of ideas, knowledge and project ideas. I use this method personally for remembering things I want to work on later. Or storing websites, articles or art pieces that inspire me so that I can reference them in the future.

Capturing things can be done on any digital platform that you enjoy. My personal choice is a combination of

- Notion
- Notes on Iphone (which I later transfer to Notion)

I have made a list of 6 principles for why this method is beneficial and why you also should start capturing everything into your second brain.

### 1. You can't be original

It's impossible to create original content. Everything that can be created is already created in some form. This is not to be discouraging but to reassure to just create whatever you want. Because on the other hand, how hard you may try to replicate something, it will always have your personal touch, and that is something that you cannot copy. So if you see anything that inspires you to make something but you think "why should I create if it's already been done?". Then remember that you will interpet that content through your own unique personal lens. You will incorporate your own personal experiences and whatever you'll create will evolve in to your own personal creation. One of my favourite books is "Steal like an artist" By Austin Kleon that goes further into this subject.

So before you start creating your second brain, keep in mind that everything you capture, create or publish will always be filtered through your own mind. This is why it's important to reassure yourself that it's okay to take ideas, inspiration and concepts from artists or people that you look up to or that trigger your creativity. Take from them, reiterate and make something even better or uniquely yours.

### 2. Capture everything

"Your brain is for creating ideas, not for storing them". That is one of my favourite quotes by David Allen. Ideas come to you over and over again, from the smallest little ideas to big life changing projects. But more than often those ideas will linger in your mind for a bit and will soon be forgotten. This is because your mind is not the place to keep all this stuff.

Write everything down. This concept comes from the Getting Things Done methodology. Capturing is the first step of offloading all those ideas from your mind and into your second brain. The place where all those thoughts, snippets and ideas belong.

Most often the first thing that will come to your mind when having an idea are one of two things.

- I will just remember this.
- This idea is not worth capturing for later use.

Both of those ideas are completely false and you know it. Sure a random past idea pops up from time to time, but most of the time this is not when you actually need to remember it. Or when you read a blog post or see a new product launch and your first thought is. "I had a conversation about this exact topic but I never did anything with it."

If you create the habit of just writing every small idea down in your own environment that you can later categorise and sift through, to actually see if this is something you want to hold on to or not. Then you will find out that you have way more ideas worth pursuing later than you could imagine. This will create a personal database of things that interest you, trigger you creatively and can always be used as reference material in future projects.

### 3. Recycle your ideas

Everything that you captured is a piece of your personal database. This doesn't have to be single use. You can reuse any captured piece of content for multiple projects. Found a piece of new technology that you like? You could use that new tech to create a series of tutorials for beginners to also get into that tech. Found a piece of art that triggers your creative bone? Create a series based on that technique to find out what makes you tick about that art style. Creating that series will also further enhance your personal database that in the future can inspire new ideas again.

So keep recycling your content, keep re-using your ideas and keep remixing it.

### 4. Think in projects

Normally when you store data or content you will start labeling all your data. This will result in small little grouped folders of data that won't have a real world use. Link your data to projects you are actually invested in and every bit of data will have a bigger impact. You will have a much easier time linking different ideas together and also recalling the placement of that data because it's linked to a bigger project that you are actually invested in.

### 5. Slow and steady wins the race

Generally people put of creative work until they are in a "creative mindspace". You have an entire weekend to tinker around on personal projects, or will think "If I can block out a full day I can get this project done". We like to think of creating our work in big chunks, but most of the time small blocks of consistent work can be way more efficient than large chunks of time hammered down on one thing.

Getting in to the habit of doing a task consistently even if it is for a short time, will build up the mental toughness of easily starting that task over and over. It's just like going to the gym. If you only go once a week and make it such an intense workout that you will dread it the next time. But if you get in to the habit of doing a small walk daily you will quickly fall in love with the additional benefits that it brings.

This also applies to creative work. Give yourself the time to process your thoughts, get new insights (and capture them!) and you will make way more meaningful things than you forcing yourself to finish a giant project in a small window of time by just brute forcing it.

### 6. Set yourself up for future success

Think of your future self as a person you haven't met yet. This idea ties in with the previous principle. Why not make life a bit more easier for your future self. Make your notes a bit more fleshed out, organise your project a bit more cleanly, add a bit more context to your thoughts or ideas. This doesn't have to be a lot, but doing a little bit frequently can add up quickly. Your future self will definitely thank you for it. Building out your personal database bit by bit will only make it more easy for yourself to start new projects with an abundance of information. With refreshing your ideas you can always look back at previous projects and use them as templates or take certain useful parts out of them to quickly start up new projects.

### Conclusion

All in all, the more you capture the quicker you can start new projects. By using previous created projects or data you can remix all your existing work. Don't let your ideas just die in your mind. Get them out of your head and get a clear mind to create your best work!
